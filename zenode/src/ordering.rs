//! Node classification and coalescing types.
//!
//! # Ordering Model
//!
//! zenode does NOT reorder user-specified node sequences. Nodes execute in
//! the order the user declared them (RIAPI querystring position, JSON array
//! index, or DAG edges).
//!
//! [`NodeRole`] is a **type tag** that tells the pipeline bridge what kind
//! of planner a node feeds into — geometry planner, filter pipeline, or
//! encode config. The bridge walks the user's node list left-to-right,
//! accumulating runs of compatible nodes and flushing when the role changes.
//!
//! Adjacent nodes with the same [`CoalesceInfo::group`] and compatible roles
//! are fused into a single operation. This fusion is always equivalent to
//! naive sequential execution — never reordering.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```text
//! User order: [orient, crop, resize, exposure, contrast, sharpen, encode]
//!
//! Bridge walks left-to-right:
//!   orient   → geometry run (start)
//!   crop     → geometry run (extend)
//!   resize   → geometry run (extend)
//!   exposure → FLUSH geometry → LayoutPlan. Filter run (start).
//!   contrast → filter run (extend — same coalesce group)
//!   sharpen  → filter run (extend — neighborhood, handled by Pipeline)
//!   encode   → FLUSH filter → FilterPipeline. Collect encode config.
//!
//! Result: Source → LayoutPlan → FilterPipeline → Encode
//! ```

/// What role a node plays in the pipeline.
///
/// Used by the bridge to collect nodes into compatible runs and feed
